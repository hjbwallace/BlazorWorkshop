# Blazor 101

Blazor is a web framework that enables developers to create interactive web apps using C# and HTML.

- Built on the ASP.NET Core framework
- Component based UI using Razor syntax
- Share classes and services between the server and UI
	
---

# Blazor Flavours

Different hosting models to suit all situations

- [Server](#6)
- [Web Assembly (WASM)](#7)
- [Hybrid](#8)
- [United](#9)

# Blazor Server

![bg right:40% 90%](images/blazor-server.png)

App hosted on an ASP.NET Core server where the browser acts as a thin client.

- [SignalR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction) connection is setup between the browser and the server
- Actions in the UI (button clicks, navigation etc) are sent to the server
- Server calculates the diff in the HTML and sends the result back to the browser



<!-- 
Good
- Easiest to get started with
- Everything is on the server so less risk of leaking code
- Quick startup

Bad
- Requires an internet connection at all time
- Can lag if there are too many events being fired
- Can struggle under large loads as each user has a connection active 
-->

# Blazor Web Assembly

![bg right:40% 90%](images/blazor-webassembly.png)

Single page apps (SPA) that run on the client browser using WebAssembly (WASM).

- Application is compiled into .NET assemblies
- Assemblies and the .NET runtime are downloaded to the client on first request
- Blazor WASM configures the runtime and uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and make API calls


<!-- 
WebAssembly is an open web standard and supported in web browsers without plugins. WebAssembly works in all modern web browsers, including mobile browsers.

Good
- Low latency
- Can run offline
- Can be setup as a PWA out of the box

Bad
- Slow inital startup as the framework is downloaded

-->

# Blazor Hybrid


- Uses web technologies in a native app
- Renders components in the UI with an embedded Web View control
- Available with MAUI, WPF and WinForms

---

# Blazor United

Why choose between Server and WASM when you can have both?

- Currently part of the .NET 8 previews
- Allows choosing how specific components are rendered
- Essentially magic
